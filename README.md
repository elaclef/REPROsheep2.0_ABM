# REPROsheep2.0_ABM 
Script of the agent-based model(ABM) described by  Laclef et al. (2022) in the article entitled "Alternative hormone free reproduction management of a dairy sheep flock disrupts the farm’s annual feeding system calendar and its associated strategies"  

This agent-based dairy sheep flock model was implemented with the GAMA software (V1.8.0) http://gama-platform.org.

# Purpose
The REPROsheep2.0 model was designed to represent the reproductive and productive dynamics in a dairy sheep flock managed with or without hormonal treatments
for induction and synchronisation of ewes' estrus. It takes into account the individual variability of estrus based on a detailed representation of the individual 
reproductive process, the individual lactation process as well as ewes' individual nutritional requirements. The objective is to simulate the impacts 
of establishing an alternative hormone-free reproduction management in a flock belonging to a typical, representative conventional semi-intensive dairy sheep farming 
system. Effects on both annual and dynamic, temporary distributions of the flock’s reproduction and milk production performances, as well as the related nutritional 
requirements repartition over time are simulated.
